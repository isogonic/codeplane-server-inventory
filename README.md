# server-inventory-mcp

An MCP server that lets an agent answer requests like **"run a security audit
on every logicplanes server"** without you having to tell it where the
servers are, how to log in, which key to use, or what the sudo password is.

It holds two things:

1. **A grouped, tagged inventory of SSH hosts** (hostname / user / port /
   identity\_file / jump\_host, or just an `ssh_alias` that resolves via
   `~/.ssh/config`).
2. **An encrypted secrets store** for passwords, sudo passwords, key
   passphrases, db credentials, API tokens — anything the agent needs
   to retrieve right before a call that consumes a credential.

Everything writable lives in your `~/.config/server-inventory/` directory:

```file-tree
[
  { "name": "~/.config/server-inventory", "type": "folder", "children": [
    { "name": "servers.json",  "hint": "inventory (no secrets, 0600)" },
    { "name": "secrets.enc",   "hint": "AES-256-GCM blob, master key in your macOS Keychain" },
    { "name": "audit.log",     "hint": "append-only JSON-lines, every mutation" }
  ]}
]
```

Use the `paths_report` tool (or `server-inv paths`) to get every file
location, including resolved identity\_file paths and ssh\_aliases that
don't resolve in your `~/.ssh/config`.

## Why

Without an inventory, an agent told to "audit all our production servers"
has to ask you which servers count, which user to connect as, which key
to use, what password / sudo password to type, every time. With this MCP
server installed it can:

1. Call `list_groups` → see groups like `logicplanes` or `production`.
2. Call `ssh_target_for { group: "logicplanes" }` → get a ready-to-run
   `ssh ...` command for every member.
3. Call `get_server { name }` → see which secrets are available
   (`secrets.keys: ["password", "sudo_password"]`).
4. Call `get_secret` immediately before the command that needs it, pipe
   the value in, never write it to disk.
5. Run the audit, aggregate the results.

You never have to dictate where things live.

## Install

Requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devinoldenburg/server-inventory-mcp.git
cd server-inventory-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

Two binaries are produced:

| Binary | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `dist/index.js` | The stdio MCP entry point. Wire this into your MCP client. |
| `dist/cli.js`   | A `server-inv` CLI that exposes every tool from your shell. |

## Register with an MCP client

### Codeplane (this is what was set up locally for you)

Add to `codeplane.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "server-inventory": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "/opt/homebrew/bin/node",
        "/absolute/path/to/server-inventory-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "environment": {
        "PATH": "/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
      },
      "enabled": true,
      "timeout": 10000
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop / Cursor / anything else

The launch command is `node dist/index.js`. Pass `SERVER_INVENTORY_PATH`,
`SERVER_INVENTORY_SECRETS_PATH`, `SERVER_INVENTORY_AUDIT_LOG`, and/or
`SERVER_INVENTORY_PASSPHRASE` in the environment block to override the
defaults below.

## File locations

| File | Default | Override |
|------|---------|----------|
| Inventory       | `~/.config/server-inventory/servers.json` | `SERVER_INVENTORY_PATH` |
| Secrets         | `~/.config/server-inventory/secrets.enc`  | `SERVER_INVENTORY_SECRETS_PATH` |
| Audit log       | `~/.config/server-inventory/audit.log`    | `SERVER_INVENTORY_AUDIT_LOG` |
| Master key      | macOS Keychain (`security`) on darwin, otherwise derived from `SERVER_INVENTORY_PASSPHRASE` via scrypt | — |
| Identity files  | wherever you keep them in `~/.ssh/` — the inventory references them by absolute or `~/` path | — |
| SSH config      | `~/.ssh/config` — owned entirely by you, never modified by this server | — |

All files except `~/.ssh/config` are created with mode `0600`.

                  └─────────────────────────┘
```

The audit log records the action and the key name, never the value. If
you grep `audit.log` for a secret string, you'll never find it.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|---------------|
| `inventory_info` | Where the inventory + secrets + audit log live; counts. |
| `paths_report` | Detailed report of every file location, including resolved identity_files (with chmod warnings) and ssh_aliases (with whether ~/.ssh/config defines them). |
| `validate_inventory` | Sanity-check every server: identity files exist, ssh_aliases resolve, every entry is reachable. |
| `list_servers` | Filter by group / tag / environment / role / free-text search. |
| `get_server` | Full record + ssh command + which secret keys are available. |
| `list_groups` | Every distinct group with member names. |
| `list_tags` | Every distinct tag with usage counts. |
| `ssh_target_for` | Resolve a name OR group OR tag to ssh commands. |
| `add_server` / `update_server` / `remove_server` | CRUD. `remove_server` cascades to delete secrets; `update_server` with `rename_to` migrates them. |
| `secrets_info` | Backend + master-key provider + secrets file path. |
| `set_secret` | Encrypt + store one value. |
| `get_secret` | Decrypt + return one value. Call this right before the command that needs it. |
| `list_secrets` | Keys for one server (never values). |
| `list_all_secrets` | Every server's keys (never values). |
| `delete_secret` | Remove one key. |
| `audit_tail` | Last N entries from the audit log. |

## The CLI

```bash
server-inv ls                          # list servers
server-inv get lp-web-1                # detail + ssh command + secret keys
server-inv groups                      # all groups with member names
server-inv targets --group logicplanes # ssh commands, one per line, ready to pipe

server-inv add lp-web-1 --host 10.0.0.5 --user ubuntu \
  --group logicplanes --group production --tag web --tag nginx \
  --env production --role web --desc "primary public web"

server-inv update lp-web-1 --port 2222 --tag tls
server-inv update lp-web-1 --rename-to lp-web-primary

echo -n 'hunter2' | server-inv secret set lp-web-1 password
server-inv secret get lp-web-1 password   # prints value to stdout
server-inv secret ls                       # all servers' keys
server-inv secret rm lp-web-1 password

server-inv paths                       # paths_report as JSON
server-inv validate                    # validate_inventory as JSON
server-inv audit --limit 20            # tail of the audit log

server-inv rm lp-web-1                 # cascades to delete secrets
```

The CLI writes to the same files as the MCP server and logs to the same
audit log (with `cli:` prefixed tool names) so an operator can tell a
manual change from an agent-driven one.

## Example: "audit all logicplanes servers"

A realistic agent flow once the inventory is populated:

```
user → agent → MCP

agent: list_groups
       ← { groups: [{ name: "logicplanes", count: 4, members: [...] }, ...] }

agent: ssh_target_for { group: "logicplanes" }
       ← { count: 4, targets: [
             { name: "lp-web-1",   command: "ssh ubuntu@10.0.0.5", ... },
             { name: "lp-db-1",    command: "ssh lp-db-1",         ... },
             { name: "lp-app-1",   command: "ssh -J ops@bastion deploy@10.0.1.20" },
             ...
         ] }

for each target:
  agent: get_server { name }
         ← { ..., secrets: { keys: ["sudo_password"], hint: "..." } }

  agent: get_secret { server, key: "sudo_password" }
         ← { value: "..." }       # used immediately, not persisted

  agent (via its own ssh tool): ssh ... 'echo "$sudo_pw" | sudo -S lynis audit system --quick'

  agent: collects findings
```

The agent never had to ask you which servers count, what credentials to
use, or where the keys live. `paths_report` would have told it everything
in one call if it ever needed to debug.

## Security model

What this server is good for:

- Personal / small-team inventory that lives on your laptop or a single
  workstation. The encrypted secrets file is unreadable without the
  master key, which never leaves your keychain (or env var).
- Replacing "credentials pasted into chat" with "credentials retrieved
  from an encrypted local store the moment the agent needs them".
- An audit trail of what was changed and when.

What it is **not**:

- A team password manager. There's no sharing, no rotation policy, no
  expiry. Use 1Password / Bitwarden / Vault if you need that.
- An access-control system. Anything that can talk to this MCP server
  can read all the secrets. Don't expose it over the network.
- Tamper-proof. The audit log is on disk and can be deleted. If you
  need cryptographically verifiable history, ship the audit log to a
  WORM store.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build     # compile TypeScript -> dist/
npm run test:unit # node --test on the unit suites
npm run smoke     # spawn the built MCP server, exercise every tool
npm test          # build + unit + smoke chained
npm run dev       # run src/index.ts directly via tsx (no build)
```

Set `SERVER_INVENTORY_TRACE=1` for stderr breadcrumbs from the lock /
load / save paths when debugging.
